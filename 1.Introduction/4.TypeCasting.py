# Int -> String
a = 123 # Int
b = "456" # String

# Now i'm converting the value of a which is int into string..
# So let's check it first...
print(a)
print(type(a))

# Now we need to assign the value of a to string, So,
# We need to make a new variable:
c = str(a)
# Here the str tells it's converting into string and (a) is value which is converting into..

print(c)
print(type(c))
# So, The output we receive is str....

# Float -> String
d = 3.14
print(d)
print(type(d))

# So, we do it in similar way,

e = str(d)
print(e)
print(type(e))
